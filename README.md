# Zyla (no-cost) referral links

Supporters generate links and get rewarded when they're used to mint.

## Overview

This project was conceived of by [Zyla](https://www.bonfire.xyz/zyla/about) as
a means to incentivize and reward supporters through the use of referral links
and is being developed by [Abstract Goods](https://abstractgoods.cc/). When
released, it will be open-source and available for use by any NFT project via
the provided website.

### Here’s how it works:

1. To enable referral links for your NFT project, first visit the project
   website to register, then follow the simple integration instructions. This
   is necessary to handle referral links that reach your site.
2. Your supporters can then use the project website (or your integration) to
   generate unique referral links and share them however they they like.
   Optionally, an ENS domain may be used instead of an Ethereum address.
3. When the link is used, the referral code and connected wallet address are
   stored on Arweave using a private key generated for your project. This data
   is well below 100KB and will be uploaded for
   [free](https://docs.bundlr.network/FAQs/general-faq#does-bundlr-offer-free-uploads) via [Bundlr](https://bundlr.network).
4. When you’re ready to distribute rewards, visit the project website again to
   view and download a complete list of successful referrals. At this point,
   all ENS domains are resolved and rewards flow to the resolved address.
5. Finally, use the referral list with your tool-of-choice to reward supporters
   via airdrops, allowlists, and more. 

### Zyla x Abstract Goods

This tool will be launched with Zyla to bring referral links to their ongoing
open edition, [still how everything stops
\[video\]](https://app.manifold.xyz/c/still-how-everything-stops-video). At the
end of the season, supporters will be able to claim one edition for each mint
associated with their referral link. This is an innovative alternative to
existing referral schemes (that commonly allocate a % of the mint price to
rewards) and a fun way for supporters to bring attention to their favorite
projects.

### Public goods funding

We have applied for ENS Small Grants, [Public Goods Round
7](https://ensgranzts.xyz/rounds/21) and look forward to launching with their
support in the coming weeks. By seeking public goods funding we intend to
establish a model for future projects with our launch partners. Funding
incentivizes partners to support the development of public goods, while
partnership ensures that funded projects are immediately useful.
